Although Doukank is based on Bagisto, we introduced brand new features to transform a simple, single vendor store into a multi-vendor store that accepts sellers as well as normal customers.


It packs in lots of demanding features:

* Multiple stores where any customer can be upgraded to be a seller.
* Multiple Channels, Locale, Currencies.
* Built-in Access Control Layer.
* Beautiful and Responsive Storefront.
* Descriptive and Simple Admin Panel.
* Admin Dashboard.
* Custom Attributes.
* Built on Modular Approach.
* Support for Multiple Store Themes.
* Orders Management System.
* Customer Cart, Wishlist, Product Reviews.
* Simple and Configurable Products.
* Price rules (Discount) inbuilt.

**For Developers**:
Dev guys can take advantage of two of the hottest frameworks used in this project Laravel and Vue.js, both of these frameworks have been used in Bagisto.
Bagisto is using power of both of these frameworks and making best out of it out of the box.
